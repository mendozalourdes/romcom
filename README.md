# About
The Romance Novel Cover Generator seeks to provide romance novel lovers the ability to engage with the interactive app in viewing, saving, and creating novel covers. With this app, each user will have the ability to view hundreds of romance novel covers at random, offering them the ability to save some of their favorites that will be conveniently stored for them. They will also be able to fuel their creative sides by creating their own covers with our "Make Your Own Cover" generator, further providing them with a more interactive experience.

 ## Technologies Used

   Javascript

   HTML

   CSS

# Instructions
1. When the user first loads the app, they are greeted by the first romance novel cover, shown at random.
2. The user can choose to continue viewing different covers by clicking on the "Show New Random Cover" button.
3. If the user wants to save a particular cover to view at a later time, they can click the "Save" button.

 ## Future Additions
Future additions to the generator will allow them to enter the "View Saved Covers" section, and view larger versions of their saved covers upon clicking the cover. Another future consideration will allow them to change the order of their saved covers, giving them the ability to view them in whichever order they choose.
